# Self-Modeling

This repository contains the code and environments used to create the results shown in the paper [Task Agnostic Self-Modeling Machines](https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/4/26/eaau9354)

Our code can be run with the following options:

```bash
python main.py --env [simple_arm_2d, simple_arm_3d] \ 
               --loop [open, closed] \
               --nb-epochs [epochs] \ 
               --nb-train-episodes [nb_train] \ 
               --nb-test-episodes [nb-test] \
               --show-model
```
